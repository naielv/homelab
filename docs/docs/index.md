# Create your own documentation!

Here you can document **your** ei23 SmartHome Server.
## Editing your documentation
You can edit the files under `/home/pi/ei23-docker/volumes/ei23/docs/docs`.
For example with directly [VSCode in the browser](http://raspberrypi:2222) (if it is installed)

## Compile documentation
Since the documentation is not yet visible after editing the *.md file, you have to compile it with the following command:
```
bash ei23.sh docs
```
or you open the menu with
```
bash ei23.sh
```

## Write documentation for ei23 ?!
If you want to support the ei23 project, you can also write useful guides for everyone else and share them. <br>
The documentation from ei23 also uses the Markdown format <br>
[You can find more information on this on the project page](https://ei23.de/diy-smarthome)

## backups
This is how you can create lists:

- By the way, the documentation is also backed up with `bash ei23.sh backup`.
- Lots of other things too, of course
- Also todolists theoretically
- Infinite possibilities

## To say in conclusion
Have fun tinkering and stay independent!

This is Felix from ei23
Have a good one!
Cheers!
